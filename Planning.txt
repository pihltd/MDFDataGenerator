** Overall Workflow
- Read MDF
- Parse required relationships
- Understand root node (almost certainly program)
- Read in user input
-- ID prefixes
-- Provided values
- If CDE has PVs, use those
- If no PV, generate random?
- How to track relationships (patient-sample-file) Pandas?


## relationships
Example File form has
- case.case_record_id - Key
- study.clinical_study_designation Key

In MDF there are:
of_study - Src: file, Dst: study
of_participant - Src: file, Dst: participant
from_sample - Src: file, Dst: sample

So, for any given node, the relationsihps are where the given node is Src, to the key of the destination
